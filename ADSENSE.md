- **Ad Slot**: `4264247550`
- **Ad Format**: Auto (responsive)
- **Full Width Responsive**: Enabled

## Ad Behavior

### Development Mode
- Ads will **NOT** display in development (`npm run dev`)
- This prevents invalid clicks and policy violations
- Check `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'` in code

### Production Mode
- Ads will display after deployment
- May take 24-48 hours for Google to review and approve
- Initially may show blank spaces until approved

## Best Practices Implemented

‚úÖ **Non-intrusive placement** - Ads don't block gameplay  
‚úÖ **Responsive design** - Ads adapt to screen size  
‚úÖ **Performance optimized** - Async loading doesn't block page  
‚úÖ **Error handling** - Graceful fallback if ads fail to load  
‚úÖ **Production-only** - No ads in development environment  

## Testing Ads

### After Deployment:

1. **Wait for Approval**: Google typically reviews new sites within 24-48 hours
2. **Check Ad Display**: Visit your live site (not localhost)
3. **Verify Responsiveness**: Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop
4. **Monitor Performance**: Check Google AdSense dashboard

### Common Issues:

**Ads not showing?**
- Wait 24-48 hours for Google approval
- Check AdSense account for approval status
- Verify site is in production (not localhost)
- Check browser console for errors

**Blank spaces?**
- Normal during review period
- May indicate low ad inventory
- Check AdSense dashboard for issues

## Revenue Optimization Tips

1. **Traffic is Key**: More visitors = more ad impressions
2. **Engagement Matters**: Longer sessions = more ad views
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Most traffic comes from mobile
4. **Content Quality**: Better content = higher CPM rates
5. **Ad Placement**: Current placements are optimized for UX

## Compliance

‚úÖ Ads don't interfere with gameplay  
‚úÖ No accidental clicks encouraged  
‚úÖ Clear distinction between content and ads  
‚úÖ Responsive and mobile-friendly  
‚úÖ Follows Google AdSense policies  

## Monitoring

- [ ] A/B testing different placements
- [ ] Ad refresh on game restart
