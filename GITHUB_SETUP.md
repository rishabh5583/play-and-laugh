Your code is ready to push to GitHub! Follow these steps:

## Option 1: Create Repository via GitHub Website (Easiest)

1. **Go to GitHub**: Visit [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)

2. **Create New Repository**:

   ```

4. **Run these commands** in your terminal:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/rishabhsharma/CascadeProjects/play-and-laugh
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/play-and-laugh.git

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
If you get authentication errors when pushing:

**Using HTTPS:**
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/play-and-laugh.git
git push -u origin main
```
You'll be prompted for your GitHub username and Personal Access Token (PAT).

**Using SSH:**
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/play-and-laugh.git
git push -u origin main
```
Requires SSH key setup on GitHub.

### Create Personal Access Token (if needed)
1. Go to GitHub â†’ Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens â†’ Tokens (classic)
2. Generate new token with `repo` scope
3. Use this token as your password when pushing

## Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Check current status

# View commit history
git log --oneline

# Check remote
git remote -v

# Push to GitHub (after adding remote)
git push -u origin main

# Future pushes (after first push)
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
```
